# DeepSort
ðŸ§  AI powered image tagger backed by DeepDetect

# Why?

Because sometimes, you have folders full of badly named pictures, and you want to be able to understand what you have in your hard drive.

# Prerequisites & installation

You need Docker installed, and you need to pull the DeepDetect image.
```
docker pull beniz/deepdetect_cpu
```

First download the latest release from https://github.com/CorentinB/DeepSort/releases
Make it executable with:
```
chmod +x deepsort
```

You also need your local 8080 port to not be mapped already.

# Usage

Just input a folder, and it will recursively rename all the pictures the following way:
```
identified-image-class_hash.ext
```
To start the tagging:
```
./deepsort FOLDER 
```

# (Really really quick) Benchmark

Tested on 605 files, it took 11m18s on an i7 7700K.

# Todo list

- [ ] Getting docker out of the loop (each user install his own DeepDetect)
- [ ] ResNet 50 integration
- [ ] XMP metadata writing
