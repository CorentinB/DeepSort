# DeepSort
ðŸ§  AI powered image tagger backed by DeepDetect

# Why?

Because sometimes, you have folders full of badly named pictures, and you want to be able to understand what you have in your hard drive.

# Prerequisites & installation

You need DeepDetect installed, the easiest way is using docker:
```
docker pull beniz/deepdetect_cpu
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/images:/path/to/images beniz/deepdetect_cpu
```

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PATH IN THE HOST SHOULD BE THE SAME IN THE CONTAINER!

Example:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /home/corentin/Images:/home/corentin/Images beniz/deepdetect_cpu
```

Right now, the only supported installation of DeepDetect that works with DeepSort is the deepdetect_cpu container.

Then, download the latest DeepSort release from https://github.com/CorentinB/DeepSort/releases

Unzip your release, rename it `deepsort` and make it executable with:
```
chmod +x deepsort
```

# Usage

DeepSort support few different parameters, you're obliged to fill two of them:
`--url` or `-u` that correspond to the URL of your DeepDetect server.
`--input` or `-i` that correspond to your local folder full of images.

For more informations, refeer to the helper:
```
./deepsort --help

[-u|--url] is required
usage: deepsort [-h|--help] -u|--url "<value>" -i|--input "<value>"
                [-n|--network (resnet-50|googlenet)] [-R|--recursive]
                [-j|--jobs <integer>] [-d|--dry-run]

                AI powered image tagger backed by DeepDetect

Arguments:

  -h  --help       Print help information
  -u  --url        URL of your DeepDetect instance (i.e: http://localhost:8080)
  -i  --input      Your input folder.
  -n  --network    The pre-trained deep neural network you want to use, can be
                   resnet-50 or googlenet. Default: resnet-50
  -R  --recursive  Process files recursively.
  -j  --jobs       Number of parallel jobs. Default: 1
  -d  --dry-run    Just classify images and return results, do not apply.
```

# Todo list

- [X] Getting docker out of the loop (each user install his own DeepDetect)
- [X] ResNet 50 integration
- [ ] Output folder (copy and not rename)
- [ ] XMP metadata writing
- [ ] GPU support
